## 其他词汇

leverage: 使用，利用

> By **leveraging** the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technology

adverse: 不利的

> Our experiments show that multi-camera configurations are critical in overcoming **adverse** conditions in large-scale outdoor scenes

streamline: 精简

> We **streamline** the training pipeline by viewing object detection as a direct set prediction problem

bypass： 跳过

omit：忽略

auxiliary loss：辅助损失

gauge：测量

design ethos: 设计理念

> The **design ethos** of DETR easily extend to more complex tasks.

ingredients: 要素

> Two **ingredients** are essential for direct set predictions in detection.

reliance: 依赖

> We show that this **reliance** on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks.

trump: 打败

> We find that large scale training **trumps** inductive bias.

inductive biases: 归纳偏置，可以理解为对现实现象进行观察后进行一些总结，对模型进行约束，比如CNN是可以保持spatial relationship信息的，这是因为我们观察到图片每个pixel之间的位置关联很重要，所以这样设计了CNN。

> Transformers lack some of the inductive biases inherent(这个词也常出现，表示内在属性） to CNNs, such as translation equivariance and locality.

alternating: 交互的，经常用来表示某几种module在模型里循环交叉出现

> The Transformer encoder consists of alternating layers of multiheaded selfattention and MLP blocks.

appetite: 需求

> This **appetite** for data has been successfully addressed in natural language processing (NLP) by self-supervised pretraining. 

harness： 驾驭，经常用于某种模型或方法没有被完全利用好

> However, its full power remains to be **harnessed** through the advent of new smart technologies, such as self-driving vehicles.

indispensable: 不可或缺的

> Detecting objects such as cars and pedestrians in 3D plays an **indispensable** role in autonomous driving.

alleviate: 减轻

> To **alleviate** the local misalignment, we use a 2D-3D bounding box consistency constraint.

account for: 占据

> Consequently, errors in depth estimation **account for** the major part of the gap between pseudo-lidar and lidar-based detectors.

consensus: 共识

> Hence, we propose a novel neural reasoning framework that learns to communicate, to estimate potential errors, and finally, to reach a **consensus** about those errors. 

degrade: 降低，损害，和performance联系紧密，常见的还有damage, decrease, drop

> In addition, we also aim to minimize the intersection-over-union (IoU) of the bounding box proposals to further **degrade** performance by producing poorly localized objects. 

hallucinating/hallucination: 原意是幻想，在CV里常用于amodal detection, 表示输入信息不直接含有某物体，但通过网络推理可以判断出物体在那。

> We dub this problem amodal scene layout estimation, which involves **hallucinating** scene layout for even parts of the world that are occluded in the image.

defacto: 实际的：这个单词本身是拉丁语，但很多论文会用到，而且要用斜体。

> We thus argue that MetaFormer is our **de facto** need for vision models that deserved more future research.

empirically 实操地，一般是想说用实验证明的意思

> we **empirically** demonstrate that the success of the transformer model is largely attributed to the MetaFormer architecture.
